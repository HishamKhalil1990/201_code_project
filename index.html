    <h1>My Biography</h1>
    <p id="p1">
      I am <strong id="osama">Osama Noufal</strong> and I am a developing manager with eight years of experience,
      graduated
      as an accountant in 2009
      from Hashemite
      University. Directly after graduation I started working in Talal Abu Ghazaeh Organization as an accountant and
      then as a senior accountant before I moved to Sweden for five years. I now concentrate in improving my brother
      business, including accounting, IT and the public relationships. I consider myself a powerful force in the
      workplace and uses my positive attitude and tireless energy to encourage others to work hard and succeed. I am
      inspired now by my collegues and my instructors in the code fellows course. In my free time, I likes to play with
      my adorable cats.
